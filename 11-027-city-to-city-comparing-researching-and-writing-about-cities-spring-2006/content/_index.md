This course introduces undergraduate planning students to the role of the planner in researching issues in cities both in the United States and abroad. This course is a practical, hands-on workshop that challenges students to research, write and present their ideas on two different cities: A U.S. City (preferably somewhere close) and Copenhagen. Students will be equipped to:

1.  select and research a thesis topic,
2.  work professionally with faculty and other experts on the topic of their choice, and
3.  research, write and present.
